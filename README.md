# Fine-tuning BERT for Text Classification through Hybrid (Classical to quantum) Transfer Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Transfer learning is a technique for machine learning in which a model created for one task is utilized as the basis for a model for a second task. Using pre-trained models as a starting point for computer vision and natural language processing tasks is a common technique in deep learning.

Transfer learning offers various advantages, but the primary ones include reduced training time, improved neural network performance (in most circumstances), and not requiring a great deal of data. Typically, a large amount of data is required to train a neural network from scratch, but access to this data is not always available. This is where transfer learning is useful. Using transfer learning, a robust machine learning model may be constructed with very minimal training data since the model has already been pre-trained. This is particularly useful in natural language processing, where the creation of huge labeled data sets often requires specialist expertise. Additionally, training time is decreased, since it may take days or even weeks to train a deep neural network for a demanding job from scratch.

BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It is intended to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by conditioning on both left and right context. It was developed in 2018 by Google's AI language researchers. It is pre-trained on a huge corpus of unlabeled text, including the whole of Wikipedia (2.5 billion words!) and the Book Corpus (800 million words). Consequently, the pre-trained BERT model may be fine-tuned with only one extra output layer to provide state-of-the-art models for a variety of NLP applications. 

As a result, it is preferable to begin with a pre-trained BERT model that was trained on a large dataset. This procedure, known as model fine-tuning, allows us to train the model further on our comparatively smaller data set.

Now we will do text categorization by fine-tuning a BERT model. There is a selection of SMS messages available. Some of these messages are spam, while others are genuine. Our mission is to create a system that can automatically determine if a particular message is spam or not.

The aim of this work is to investigate the potential of the transfer learning paradigm in the context of quantum machine learning.
We concentrate on hybrid models, i.e., the situation in which quantum variational circuits and conventional neural networks (BERT) may be co-trained for NLP tasks.

In the current era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, classical to quantum (CQ) transfer learning is particularly attractive because it enables the classical pre-processing of large input samples with any state-of-the-art deep neural network, followed by the manipulation of a small number of highly informative features with a variational quantum circuit. This system is highly practical because it combines the capabilities of quantum computers with the tried-and-true techniques of conventional machine learning.
